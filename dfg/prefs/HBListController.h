 * controllers within a preference bundle, and bug fixes for common issues
 * within the Settings app and Preferences framework. In particular,
 * a bug with the list controller's content disappearing after closing the
 * Settings app and opening it again is worked around, as well as an issue on
 * iOS 7 where in some cases a cell may stay highlighted after being tapped.
 *
 * It includes two class methods you can override to return the name of a
 * Preferences specifier property list, and a tint color for the interactable
 * elements within the list controller.
