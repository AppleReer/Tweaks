Hello /r/jailbreak,

I am Carter Kane, Sadie Kane's older brother, I am writing this reddit at her request because she feels her english is not good enough for the task, so all words from this point forward are hers just translated into english by me at the best of my ability. @Ziph0n on twitter also helped me translate some things I didn't know how to write in English so thanks in advance to him.

Hello, I'm Sadie Kane, a 17 year old developer from Paris, I have been developing iOS Tweaks for a little over a year now but all of my previous tweaks have been private things just for myself. When iOS 10 became somewhat jailbreakable I decided to make a public tweak so I started working on a tweak I call **Ogygia**. Ogygia is meant to provide a dark mode for different elements on SpringBoard (Anything that isn't in a app is mostly likely SpringBoard). Some of the elements included are Notifications, ControlCenter, Widgets, and 3D Touch Menus. 

I have worked very hard to make sure everything about the tweak is simple while also covering even the tiniest aspects like the small **x** in the clear button in the Notification Center. I have also made sure the tweak is easy to which is why from the start I developed this tweak with the intention of users not being required to respring to toggle dark mode on and off. I have periodically released screenshots of my progress on my twitter account [@caleo2017](https://twitter.com/caleo2017) so go check that out if you want to see a timeline of me developing the tweak. 

I have also worked very hard to make sure it is compatible with other tweaks dark mode tweaks like Eclipse by [@fr0st](https://twitter.com/fr0st). I have also made sure it is compatible with other released and upcoming tweaks like Confero2 by [@AtomDevTeam](https://twitter.com/AtomDevTeam), a upcoming suprise tweak by [@e_swick](https://twitter.com/e_swick), tweaks like Platters, Cream2, and Creamless by [@cpdigdarkroom](https://twitter.com/cpdigdarkroom), Horseshoe by [@andywiik](https://twitter.com/andywiik), and FlipControlCenter by [@rpetrich](https://twitter.com/rpetrich).

Right now only iOS 10+ is supported but I am considering supporting iOS 9 for things like the ControlCenter in the future. Ogygia is mostly complete for a release at this state but I will be waiting for a stable release of Yalu before releasing it to the public. I wanted to make this post to inform you of its progress as well as share a more comprehensive set of screenshots of what the tweak changes and how everything looks, you can find them below in a Imgur Album.

I also understand [@LaughingQuoll](https://twitter.com/LaughingQuoll) has released a similiar tweak named **Noctis** for $1.99. He has contacted me regarding similarities between the two tweaks but after seeing the tweak he released I believe I can provide a more visually stunning, comprehensive, and stable tweak. Of course I leave that judgement up to the people that try my tweak when it is released.

Thank you for your time,
